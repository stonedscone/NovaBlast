        <p>A Website created for the pure expression of free will <br>
        and pure determination to make a bunch of crap for no reason at all! <br>
        I will be editing this website and adding more stuff as time goes on! <br>
        Feel free to make suggestions!</p>

        <p> There is something very interesting about simple games, especially <br>
        those made in HTML, since it is a rather interesting way to go about it considering <br>
        much of the game logic is created through JavaScript. Whilst CSS is used to style whatever <br>
        you want, but in code like snake game most assets were defined in the JS file. <br>
        This is due to how it was written.</p>
